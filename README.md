# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
It is used to recognize the handwritten digits with the help of logistic regression and neural networks.I trained the logistic regression algorithm on a dataset and whenever new image is tested the algorithm classifies it as 0 to 9 with the help of One vs All classifier.Similar process is repeated with neural networks.

You can write any number and click image and run the algorithms on image it will predict your handwritting.
Results from Neural Networks were more accurate as compared to Logistic Regression
