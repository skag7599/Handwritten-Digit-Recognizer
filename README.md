# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
It is used to recognize the handwritten digits with the help of logistic regression and neural networks.I trained the logistic regression algorithm on a dataset and whenever new image is tested the algorithm classifies it as 0 to 9 with the help of One vs All classifier.Similar process is repeated with neural networks.
